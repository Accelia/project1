<p>
The first time I write my full name

<strong>"Jacqueline Amanda Woodson"</strong>

without anybody's help
on a clean white page in my composition notebook,
I know

if I wanted to
<strong>I could write anything.</strong></p>

<p>Letters becoming words, words gathering meaning,
becoming
thoughts outside my head

becoming sentences
written by
<strong>Jacqueline Amanda Woodson</strong></p>
